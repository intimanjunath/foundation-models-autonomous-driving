# Foundation Models: Transforming Autonomous Driving 🚗🤖

Welcome to the official repository for my short story assignment based on the survey paper by Gao et al. (2024). This repository includes my Medium article, presentation slides, and YouTube video, clearly outlining the impact of Foundation Models on autonomous driving.

---

## 📌 Overview

Foundation Models have dramatically reshaped autonomous driving by transitioning from traditional modular systems (perception, prediction, planning, control) to unified, multi-capable architectures. This repository explores these transformative models—Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), and Multi-modal Foundation Models (MFMs)—highlighting their capabilities, current challenges, and future research directions.
